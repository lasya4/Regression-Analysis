# Relationship between Sleep Patterns and BMI in NHANES Data: An Analysis of Obesity-Related Health Outcomes
# Regression-Analysis

This study examines the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and sleep patterns
 specifically sleep duration and perceived sleep qualityâ€”using NHANES 2017-2018 data. A
 multiple linear regression model and an interaction model were developed to quantify the effects
 of sleep predictors on BMI while adjusting for demographic confounders such as age, gender,
 socioeconomic status, and physical activity. Results suggest a significant negative association
 between sleep duration and BMI, moderated by gender and age. Diagnostics confirm model
 assumptions, ensuring reliability. Our findings emphasize sleep as an essential factor in obesity
 prevention strategies.
